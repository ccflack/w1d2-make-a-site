      On Beer
    </h1>
    <section>
      <p>
        Everyone knows something about beer. Maybe the only thing know is that you don't like it. Maybe you consider yourself a connoisseur. Wherever you fall on that sepctrum, you've probably had that moment of surprise where you walk into a bar 27 taps and a <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/bieres.html">bottle list like a phone book</a>, and suddenly you realize you don't know nearly as much as you thought you did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully, this will help.

      <h3>
        The Basics
      </h3>
      <img src= "http://www.naturalblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beer.jpg" alt="Water, Malt, Hops" class="heading-img">
      <p>
        First, a little history. People have been making and drinking "beer" of some description for almost 10,000 years. Seriously, we've found jars from around at least 7,000 BCE that were used used to brew the stuff in Mesopotamia. Some of our earliest examples of writing and law are about beer. There was a section on beer in Hammurabi's Code.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that much history, the question "What is it?" is too broad for the time we've got, but it's worth mentionning before we jump in. For now, we'll stick with modern definitions. Very basically, we can boil it down 3 ingredients (See what I did there? You will in a minute.). They are:
      </p>
      <ol class="list">
        <li>
          <strong>Water</strong> - This one's pretty self explanitory, but there's still some variation here. Things like pH levels, chemical traces, and mineral content all make a difference in the final product.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Malt</strong> - Any kind of grain (barley, wheat, corn, even rice) roasted, then lightly milled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hops</strong> - The flower or "cone" of a species of plant called <i>Humulus lupulus</i>. These give beer it's bitterness and aroma, and act as a natural preservative.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        That's it. Everything else is optional. There's a finer science to it, but all you need to do now is boil these 3 things and wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        The waiting is important, this is how your mix (called wort) turns alcoholic and becomes somethign you'll recognize as beer. Yeasts will go through this wort eating up sugars produced in the boil, and turning them into alcohol and CO<sub>2</sub>. This gas is what makes gives the final product its signature fizziness.
      </p>

        What's the difference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        So if that's it, how did we end up with that phone book full of beers? Even with only 3 ingredients, there's a lot of room for variety. The chemistry of the water is too deep a subject to cover here, but suffice it to say, it matters. Other things that give you variation are the grains used, how long they are roasted, the variety of hops used, and when they are added to the boil.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last factor we haven't mentioned yet is the yeast. You can take two batches of the exact same wort and expose them to different yeasts, and you'll end up with two totally different beers. There's a lot of biology at work here, and the breeding of specific yeast strains has become a huge industry growing up alongside craft brewing. You can even use wild yeasts to ferment your beer by leaving it out in open air.

      <h3>
        Styles
      </h3>
      <p>
        All these options make for a pretty complicated family treed. There are a few well-established styles that make this mess a little easier to talk about. The two main branches of this tree are ales an lagers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ales</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Lagers</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The biggest difference here is a technicality that only the brewer will know for certain. <strong>Ales</strong> ferment at higher temperatures and their yeast forms a foamy layer of <i>kr√§usen</i> on top of the fermenting beer. <strong>Lagers</strong>, on the other hand ferment at colder temperatures, and don't typically create this layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most styles of come from the ale branch, but there are generally more lagers produced by volume. This is because most American-style mass produced beers (Budweiser, Bud Light, Coors, etc.) are lagers, and their production capacity is incredibly high. Quality control and mass production are much easier at lower regulated temperatures and for this reason, these beers tend to have a similar flavor profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is considerably more varity in the ale family from darker stouts and porters with their heavily-roasted coffee-like flavors, to heady India pale ales with much hoppier flavors. There's an incredible range of flavors and styles, and the best way to learn what you like is to try them. That's not something I can help with here, you're on your own for that part.
